# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

## Objectives:

The objective of the project is to create an interactive menu system for a restaurant website, enabling users to browse menu items conveniently categorized into starters, main courses, and desserts. Users can select items by clicking on them, which are then added to an order list displayed on the page. Additionally, the system calculates the total price of the order based on the selected items. By providing these features, the project enhances the user experience of the website visitors, making it easier for them to explore menu options and place orders seamlessly.

## Reflections:

This project was both challenging and rewarding as I had to apply my Javascript fundemental knowledge, such as loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation, to overcome various technical challenges, including dynamically generating menu items and handling user interactions. Collaborating with my classmates allowed me to learn from their knowlege which helped me see and find new ways to code.

## Challenges faced

The challenges I faces with this project were  implementing JavaScript concepts, managing project scope and time effectively, designing a user-friendly interface, debugging code, and documenting progress. Also balancing technical learning with practical application was a bit of a challenge for me.

 ## Areas for Improvement:

 Understanding and Using Javascript better. I need to learn how to write code that is user-friendly and clean.



## Overall learning experience:

This project deepened my understanding for Javascript Fundementals, it also exposed areas where I need more practice on. It exposed me to real-life scenarios to show how I can use Javascript to solve real-life problems.
